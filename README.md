# Zauberling-v0.2
This is the Arduino software written for my second prototype of a module with a Atmega328P 5V 16Mhz board to be used with vintage fischertechnik 'Silberlings'.

More information about the first prototype can be found at https://www.whizzbizz.com/en/microcontroller-module-with-atmega328p-and-tb6612fng

With this v0.2 incarnation I've added a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED display and removed the servo outputs. A fourth input was added and manual trigger and reset buttons where added to the front. 
Furthermore the FTDI (TTL-level) program bus and the I2C bus are now available at the back of the module on a universal power supply pcb that can be used in the 3D printed 'Silberlings'.

This is a work in progress, but eventually I'll publish the 3D print files and the latest versions of the Gerber files of both the universal power and interface pcb and the main pcb overhere.
